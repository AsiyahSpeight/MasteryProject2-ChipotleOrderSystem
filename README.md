SOURCES
A list of all references used to complete the assignment, including peers (if applicable)
LLM ChatGPT, was used as a guide to ensure the code ran smoothly with no issues. Gemini was attempted, but didn't give the best results as ChatGPT did, therefore it was not referenced 
in my code as I did not use any of the suggestions it gave me. Lecture material was used as a guide, specifically the lecture on classes, as ThreadsAccount class that was built in class was used as a guide, the 
driver for the class, as well as the second class was built using the same class that was built in class. Professors office hours was also used, references came in the form of help.
